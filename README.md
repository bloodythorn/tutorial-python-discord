# Learn how to code a Python bot for Discord!

  This is meant to go along with my Twitch streamed tutorial on how to code in Python, specifically how to code a discord bot.

## Who is this aimed at?

  I wrote this for a friend. I really tried my hardest to target this at a specific type of person. To optimally follow this tutorial, you will want to be as close to this person as possible:

  * You have little to no programming knowledge
  * You intuitively understand technical things
  * Most likely working on a PC in Windows or Linux is easy for you
  * You have no issues filling in the blanks when given hints on what to look for. Researching to learn things that aren't included, but required, is very, very necessary.
  * You want to learn to program for any reason. Python is a great place to start.
